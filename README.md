FEWD assignment 1
## Introductions
Hi I'm **sirisha**! I am a _**web developer and designer**_.

My name is sirisha.I did my Masters in Engineering(M.E) in Electronics back in india.I had some computer subjects both in B.Tech and M.E like C,Data Structures,Data base Management Systems,Computer Networking etc from which i got some knowledge.I did some courses outside of my college connected to Datawarehousing,specifically Informatica which is an ETL tool and a database(Oracle).I would like to do FEWD Course as it combines both technology as well as individual talent as people can see our creativity.I feel privileged to be in a class with students from different countries and especially with instructor emily where i feel comfortable and understanding.I have a hobby of doing arts and crafts with clay and fondant.Sometimes i do terracota jewellery just for fun.I also make photo books,personalised calendars as gifts to family.

I am glad that i finished fewd1 succesfully with lot of knowledge and entered fewd2.Thanks to emily again.Hopefully i can do fewd2 my best.welcome to all my peers again.

These are some things i like to do:
* Design cool stuff
* play
* visit places
